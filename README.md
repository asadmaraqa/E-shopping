# Fullstack-Typescript-Project "E-shopping"

E-shopping is an e-commerce website where you can search for a product on the website and read more about the product. You can also choose the size and the color of the product. After that you can add the product to the cart.
The website has two user roles, they can sign in or sign up through their Google account:
1. Normal user, which can sign in and sign up to edit or add their personal information, such as an address or a phone number.
2. Admin user, which can add, delete or edit a product. Also the Admin can delete or ban a user.
